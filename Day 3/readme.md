# Day 3

We have issue with Vitis because it does not have option such as adding platform. Therefore, we need to install Vitis again.

In day three we continue working on Vitis. Next, we reviewd flip flip, how series of flip flop can be used for shift register. The application of them can be UART.

SR Latch is run on Vivado to understand the mechanism

- This is a LAB for SR-Latch

May be in the next few days, I will try to learn contents in this lab. Thanks UMBC!!!
