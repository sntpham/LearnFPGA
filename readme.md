# Motivation

I always want to learn how to program FPGA and Verilog; however, I kept making excuses and trying to find a good time to learn.

Good time is when we start it, I guess.

So now, having time, set out a goal to learn basic FPGA in 10 days.

Each Day I will post a video on new topics, until I can work on a big project that I have in mind.

- Day 1: Completed  [[FPGA] Verilog and Vivado  - Day 1: Toggle LED, Run Behavior Simulation, Basic Verilog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF9M0mKaNOo)
- Day 2: Completed  [[FPGA ]Verilog and Vivado - Day 2: UART, and Block Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlsMUx563E)
- Day 3: Completed  [[FPGA ]Verilog and Vivado - Day 3: Vitis, Books, Multiplexer, SR Latch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSCz_gARiL8)
- Day 4: Completed  [[FPGA ]Verilog and Vivado - Day 4: Vivado command line with VScode, implement delay, RAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtyqb_SaB0w)
