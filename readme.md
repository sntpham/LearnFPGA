# Motivation

I always want to learn how to program FPGA and Verilog; however, I kept making excuses and trying to find a good time to learn.

Good time is when we start it, I guess. 

So now, having time, set out a goal to learn basic FPGA in 10 days.

Each Day I will post a video on new topics, until I can work on a big project that I have in mind.

- Day 1: Completed
- Day 2: Completed
- Day 3: In progress
