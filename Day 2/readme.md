I want to send UART signal out. One way to do it it to include the MicroBlaze Block which is a software-defined system on chip built on top of the FPGA fabric. 

More about MicroBlaze and detailed tutorial can be found here: https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1579-microblaze-embedded-design/Using-a-MicroBlaze-Processor-in-an-Embedded-Design
